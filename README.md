For images:
Place folder in desktop named "resources"
inside it add 2 folders named "Images" & "Thumbnails"
then add images to Images folder and place small sized thumbnails of Images into Thumbnails Folder.
make sure that thumbnails images have a small size between 1 to 100kb, that will give good performance.
